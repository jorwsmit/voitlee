GitHub Theme URI: https://github.com/understrap/understrap
Description: Combination of AutomatticÂ´s _s theme and Bootstrap 4. Made as a solid starting point for your next theme project and WordPress website. Use it as starter theme or as a parent theme. It is up to you. Including Font Awesome support, built-in widget slider and much more you need for basic websites. IMPORTANT: All developer dependencies are not bundled with this install file. Just download the .zip, extract it and run "npm install" and "gulp copy-assets" inside the extracted /understrap folder.
That downloads everything and moves it in place so that you can recompile your CSS and JS files;
A developer version (with Gulp/node and Sass sources) is available on gitHub: https://github.com/understrap/understrap
A child theme is available on Github, too: https://github.com/understrap/understrap-child;
